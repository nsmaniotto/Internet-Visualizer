# Internet-Visualizer v1.1.0


The goal of this web application is to illustrate how networks work by gradually implementing features such as layers and protocols.

Within this interactive app, users will be able to play around with what contains a real network in order to slowly understand, thanks to popularized concepts, how hosts (computers, smartphones, printers, etc.) can communicate.


## v1.1.0 features:

- User can add
	- Hosts
	- Hubs
	- Switches
	- Routers

- User can connect network components through their interfaces

- User can drag and add protocols to the network components


## Planned improvements and features:

- Implementation of protocols' behaviour
- Ability to send messages from an host to a certain destination
- Ability to see transmitted datas in 'real time' (slowed)
- Ability to see transmitted datas step by step
- Improve overall design
