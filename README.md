# Internet-Visualizer v1.0.0


The goal of this web application is to illustrate how networks work by gradually implementing features such as layers and protocols.

Within this interactive app, users will be able to play around with what contains a real network in order to slowly understand, thanks to popularized concepts, how hosts (computers, smartphones, printers, etc.) can communicate.


## v1.0 features:

- User can add
	- Hosts
	- Hubs
	- Switchs
	- Routers


## Planned improvements:

- Adding protocols, their configurations and algorithms
- Ability to link hosts/hubs/switchs/routers
- Ability to send messages from an host to a certain destination
- Simulate packets within the network
- Improve overall design
